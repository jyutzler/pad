Filename padder for files numbered 1, 2...,10...

Back Story:
   * Version 6.0.4 of the emusic.com Download Manager creates files named like the following:
      * 1. Where the Streets Have No Name.mp3
      * 2. I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For.mp3
      * ...
      * 10. Exit.mp3
      * 11. Mothers of the Disappeared.mp3
   * the MP3 player in my car orders files by filename (1, 10, 11, 2, 3...)
   * listening to tracks out of order DRIVES ME CRAZY
   
Solution:

Put this file in the parent directory of your MP3 files and run it.
It adds a '0' in front of the first 9 files so that they play in the proper order in my car.

It works on my machine.

Good luck!
